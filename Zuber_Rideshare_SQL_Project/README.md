# Zuber Rideshare SQL Poject

For this SQL exclusive project I was given the brief:  
- You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

- For this project I was not given access to the raw data, or able to export my query results into a spreadsheet for analysis, but I enjoyed seeing the returned results of specific tables.

 - I ran several queries for different kinds of information, examples demonstrated include:  
1: Date specific trips quantity for all recorded taxi businesses.  
2: Weekly trip quanties, seperating the top two carriers with others grouped.  
3: Duration and weather of trips to airport locations on a specific Saturday.
