# Zuber Rideshare SQL Analysis

For this SQL exclusive project I was given the brief:
You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

## Objectives

- Identify top taxi services
- 
- Discern the impact of weather on ride frequency and duration.
- 

## Tools Used

- SQL (written and run via [TripleTen])
- Dataset provided by [insert source or leave blank if proprietary]

ALthought there was no analysis report required, I had some takeaway conclusions from the query results summarized below.

## Insights
- Flash Cab carried the highest volume
- Weather
