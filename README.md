# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [Zomato Restaurant Aggregator](./Zomato_Restaurant_Aggregator/README.md) | The project was limiting analysis to one area of the dataset, in which I chose to research customer demographics in relation to sales. I used spreadsheets to clean the raw data, Tableau for visualiztion, and produced a written report summary of conclusions and reccommendations.
| 2 | [Superstore Analysis, 1](./Superstore_Analysis_1/README.md) | The project task was utilizing Tableau to analyze profit metrics, advertising, and returns, in order to produce high-impact suggestions |
| 3 | [Superstore Analysis, 2](./Superstore_Analysis_2/README.md) | The project task was to analyze returns data, highlighting trends, geographic concentrations, and categorical considerations for the rate and volume of returns. The brief was met by building Tableau dashboards and presenting analysis results. |
| 4 | [Zuber Project](./Zuber_Rideshare_SQL_Project/README.md) | The project involved SQL to find and analyze data on routes and the impact of weather conditions. |
| 5 | Airbnb | The project involved using Excel to analyze rental data in NYC in order to determine the characteristics of the most profitable conditions from a developers point of view. |
